# Yii2-backup
Backup and Restore functionality for Yii2 applications.

This extension is a fork of:
- [yii2-backup](https://github.com/amoracr/yii2-backup) by [Alonso Mora](https://github.com/amoracr),

This extension is based on:
- [yii2-backup](https://github.com/demisang/yii2-backup) by [Ivan Orlov](https://github.com/demisang),
- [yii2-backup](https://github.com/elleracompany/yii2-backup) by [Ellera](https://github.com/elleracompany).
- [php-sqlite-dump](https://github.com/ephestione/php-sqlite-dump) by [ephestione](https://github.com/ephestione)
- [extract-folder-content-using-ziparchive](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8102379/extract-folder-content-using-ziparchive)
- [loading-sql-files-from-within-php](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/147821/loading-sql-files-from-within-php)

I combined those sources and made a more powerful and easier to use extension.

Supported databases:
- MySQL
- MariaDB (via MySQL driver)
- SQLite
- PostgreSQL

Supported compression methods:
- Bzip2
- Gzip
- Zip

By default the backup files is a tar file with sql dumps and folders.

Current limitations:
- Requires a linux system.
- Currently only MySQL on localhost is supported.
- Currently only MariaDB on localhost is supported.
- Currently only PostgreSQL on localhost is supported.
